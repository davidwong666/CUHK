-----------------------------------------End of Code-----------------------------------------
Description:
Given a series of the height of buildings, for each building, please calculate the number of unblocked buildings it can see ahead.
We say that the i-th building with the height h_i is blocked by the j-th building with the height h_j only if i < j and h_i <= h_j.
The unblocked building (the j-th building) that the i-th building can see ahead satisfies: (1) j < i (2) not blocked by any k-th buildings with k < i.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) total time.

Input:
The first line contains one integer: N;
The second line contains N integers, h_0, h_1, ..., h_(N-1), each of which is the height of each buildings;
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= h_i <= 10^3

Output:
N integers, each of which is the number of unblocked buildings that the i-th building can see ahead;

Sample Input 1:
11
5 3 8 3 2 5 5 5 6 8 11
input 2:
11
1 5 64 1 3 4 8 9 1 1 1
output 2:
0 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 3

Sample Output 1:
0
1
2
1
2
3
2
2

Reason:
The 1-th output integer 0: 	
For the 1-th building 5, nothing is in front of it

The 2-th output integer 1: 
For the 2-th building 3, it can see one building ahead (5)

The 3-th output integer 2: 	
For the 3-th building 8, it can see two buildings ahead (5 3)

The 4-th output integer 1: 
For the 4-th building 3, it can see one building ahead (8) as the 1-th and 2-th buildings are blocked by the 3-th building

The 5-th output integer 2: 
For the 5-th building 2, it can see two buildings ahead (8 3)

The 6-th output integer 3: 
For the 6-th building 5, it can see three buildings ahead (8 3 2)

The 7-th output integer 2: 
For the 7-th building 5, it can see two buildings ahead (8 5) as the 4-th and 5-th buildings are blocked by the 6-th building 

The 8-th output integer 2: 
For the 8-th building 5, it can see two buildings ahead (8 5) as the 6-th building is blocked by the 7-th building

Hints: 
The description of the function, DoSomething, may be helpful.
